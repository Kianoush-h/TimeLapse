# Timelapse Video Creator

This Python script enables you to create a timelapse video from a sequence of images in a folder. The script uses the `imageio` library to generate the timelapse video.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install imageio
```

## Usage

1. Place all the images you want to include in the timelapse in a folder.
2. Update the `image_folder` variable in the script with the path to your image folder.
3. Run the script to generate the timelapse video.

Adjust the parameters in the script to customize the frame rate and other settings according to your requirements.

## Example

```python
# Set the path to the folder containing the images
image_folder = 'path_to_your_image_folder'
# Set the desired frame rate for the video
fps = 3

# ... (rest of the script)
```
